description: Establish or repair the ReadMe API key behind execute-request. Use when a ReadMe call fails with "Missing Security Schemes", "The API key couldn't be located", or "An unknown error has occurred", when the user asks which project their key reaches, when they say they set a key but it is not working, and before the first write to their project.

# The key behind execute-request

The plugin ships anonymous. Public reads of ReadMe's documentation need no key; anything touching
the user's own project does, and it travels on the MCP server registration rather than in the tool
call. See the `mcp-server` skill for which calls land where.

## Assume anonymous

Most users have not registered a key, so do not spend a call proving it. Go straight to the work:

- ReadMe documentation questions — `search` and `fetch`, no key involved.
- The user's project, and they have not mentioned a key — go to **No key yet** below.
- The user says they registered one, or an `execute-request` call fails — verify with the probe.

## Verify

`execute-request`, spec title `ReadMe API`, with no `Authorization` header of your own:

```json
{
  "title": "ReadMe API",
  "harRequest": {
    "method": "get",
    "url": "https://api.readme.com/v2/projects/me"
  }
}
```

| Response | Means | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A project object | The registration carries a working key | Name the project and subdomain, carry on. Ask for nothing |
| `Missing Security Schemes` | No `Authorization` header at all — the server is anonymous | **No key yet** |
| `"title": "The API key couldn't be located."`, status 401 | A key is being sent, but it is not a real key | **A key is set but wrong** |
| `"title": "An unknown error has occurred."`, status 500 | The bearer is empty — the variable resolved to nothing | **A key is set but wrong** |

Resolve this once per session. Having seen a project object, send no `Authorization` header of your
own for the rest of the session.

## No key yet

If the user has not named a project, ask, and wait. Pick no project, infer none from open files or
earlier turns, and read no guides to narrow it down. Ask which project, and whether they would rather
register the key with the server or paste it in chat.

Offer the better option first:

- **Preferred:** they register the server with the key themselves, so it stays out of the chat. The
  plugin README has the `~/.cursor/mcp.json` snippet. They create the key under **Configuration →
  API Keys** in ReadMe. This takes an editor restart, since the header resolves when the server
  connects.
- **Otherwise:** they paste it and you send it as a header on each call:

  ```json
  {
    "title": "ReadMe API",
    "harRequest": {
      "method": "get",
      "url": "https://api.readme.com/v2/projects/me",
      "headers": [{ "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer rdme_..." }]
    }
  }
  ```

  This works, and it also puts the key in the transcript. Say so, and tell them to rotate it.

Send a header of your own **only** when the probe returned `Missing Security Schemes`. A header on the
server registration overrides anything you set in `harRequest`, so against a registered server a
pasted key is silently ignored and the call lands in whichever project the registration owns — no
error, just the wrong project.

## A key is set but wrong

Both failures mean an `Authorization` header is reaching the API and the API is rejecting it. The
usual cause is a placeholder in `mcp.json` — `${env:README_API_KEY}` — that the client resolved to
nothing, or passed through as literal text, because the variable is unset:

- **Status 500, `An unknown error has occurred.`** — the header arrived empty.
- **Status 401, `The API key couldn't be located.`** — a value arrived, but no such key exists.
  Also what a revoked or mistyped key returns.

Say that plainly before asking them to paste anything. Ask them to confirm the variable is exported
in the environment the editor launched from, then restart the editor. If the key is genuinely gone,
they create a new one under **Configuration → API Keys**.

Do not work around either failure by probing with `curl` or by retrying against the `Legacy API`
spec. One key maps to one project; if the call reaches the wrong project, the registration is the
thing to change.
